# INTRO TO ADVANCED HTML
This is a project we're doing for the week.
I'll be implemeting from scratch a webpage from a designer file on Figma.
This project is purely focused on HTML semantic.
My readme file is going to be a little *fancier* than usual.
So let's start with a Q and A, shall we?

## Why are you doing this?
Why are we all here on this big floating rock anyway, huh?
But seriously, it's a school project that I am required to do.

## When did you start doing HTML?
Last week, so my knowledge is still pretty basic.

## Is it true that programmers are weirdos?
Is is true that I was with your mum last night?

## No one's even asking you these questions, you're literally talking to yourself?
I am superior in every way.

## Okay, what's your school project going to look like?
